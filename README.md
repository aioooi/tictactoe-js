# A Tic Tac Toe Engine Written in JavaScript

This is a JavaScript module implementing an engine for 
[Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

It is based on my Python implementation you can find in
[aioooi / **tictactoe-py**](https://github.com/aioooi/tictactoe-py), and it is used in my
Svelte-based SPA [aioooi / **tictactoe-svelte**](https://github.com/aioooi/tictactoe-svelte).
